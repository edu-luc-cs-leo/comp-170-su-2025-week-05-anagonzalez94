# Midterm Review
Looking back on the first six weeks of COMP 170, I think I have finally begun to find my footing. It has been a learning curve to manage my time appropriately, this being my first summer class, but I think I have been improving and hope to maintain that momentum going into the rest of the term.
In terms of assignments, I think I have made decently steady progress. I am still mastering the art of helpful commentary, something I almost completely lacked in my first coding assignment. After seeing examples from the posted homework solutions, I've been better able to conceptualize what is expected of me. Another point of improvement has been time management and completion. I learned the hard way that I need to allot enough time to properly complete coding assignments (because they can be hard to gauge until you're up to your knees), and intend not to make that mistake again.
My attendance and engagement in class is realistically another point of improvement, if only because of this past week. I do my best to join class on time, with all of the resources that I need (GitHub, notebook, etc) at my disposal. Something that I could certainly improve is the amount of time I spend studying outside of class. Admittedly, I kind of underestimated this class. But I like a challenge, and intend to push myself to become a more proactive and eager student.
I truly have enjoyed this class so far, and feel like I have learned a lot in such a little time. I hope that this appreciation is felt.
